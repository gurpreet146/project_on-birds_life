                <h1> life cycle of birds </h1>
                <h2> Bird life cycle stages</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h3>stages1 - the egg</h3>
                        <p>All birds start their lives inside an egg; for the most part, which is a white, yellow,
                            hard-shell
                            covering the outside of the developing bird's undeveloped embryo. The number of eggs laid
                            and
                            the
                            size of eggs differ starting with one species then onto the next. A few birds lay one egg
                            while
                            different birds lay more than one egg. A bird called Gray Partridge is known to lay around
                            20
                            eggs.
                            The eggs are brooded by one of the parent birds, for the incipient embryo to form into a
                            chick.
                            A
                            hard and bony structure frames on the baby bird's beak, which is known as the egg tooth. So
                            as
                            to
                            hatch, the baby bird utilizes the egg tooth to break the eggshell. </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <h3>stages2 - the hatching</h3>
                        <p>After the bird has come out of the egg, the newly hatched bird is known as a hatchling. A
                            hatchling is covered in the soft features and can't fly in this stage. Because of its
                            vulnerable
                            nature, a hatchling becomes prey to numerous huge predators. They need extraordinary
                            parental
                            management to grow and develop in this stage. At the point when a hatchling is developing
                            and
                            taken care of by its parents inside the nest, it is called to be nestling. </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>stages3 - the nesting</h3>
                        <p>In this stage, the bird attempts to fly and shows certain flight qualities. At the point when
                            a
                            nestling builds up its flight capacities and is set up to take its first flight, the bird is
                            known as a fledgeling.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>stages4 - the fledgeling</h3>
                        <p>A fledgeling has completely developed plumes and solid muscle wings. Despite the fact that
                            they
                            have every one of these highlights, fledgelings are still under the consideration of their
                            folks
                            at some point. In this stage, the bird flies out of the nest yet not at significant
                            distances.
                            The timespan of this stage in birds changes starting with one stage then onto the next. </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>stages5 - the juvenil</h3>
                        <p>In this stage, the young birds are yet not completely grown as they don't have adult plumage.
                            In
                            this stage, the young birds are not explicitly mature too. Again this changes, depending
                            upon
                            the sort of species of birds. Some bird species explicitly mature in this stage, while some
                            don't.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>stages6 - the sub adult</h3>
                        <p>In this stage, the young birds are yet not completely grown as they don't have adult plumage.
                            In
                            this stage, the young birds are not explicitly mature too. Again this changes, depending
                            upon
                            the sort of species of birds. Some bird species explicitly mature in this stage, while some
                            don't. </p>

                    <li>
                        <h3>stages7 - the adult</h3>
                        <p>The adult bird has conclusive plumage and is explicitly mature. In this stage, the bird can
                            mate
                            and perform rearing.</p>
